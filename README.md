# Loan-Prediction
## Problem statement: 
<p>Finance companies deal with housing loans. They have across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first apply for home loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan. These companies wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on the customer details provided while filling the online application form. These details are gender, marital status, education, number of dependents, income, loan amount, credit history and others.<br>To automate this process, finance companies have given a problem to identify the customers segments , those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. </p>

## Objectives:
* Data Gathering
* Data Formatting
* Data Cleaning
* Data Modelling
* Test and Analysis
* Data Visualization

## Conclusion
<p>I have prepared a prediction model for predicting loans for banks. 
The accuracy can be improved by adding more data into the training model. 
If further worked on this project, it can be converted into a tool with some user interface which could be beneficial, time saving and more accurate therefore removing human errors.
